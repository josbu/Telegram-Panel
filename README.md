[English](README.md) | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A multi-account Telegram management panel built with **WTelegramClient**, a **.NET 8**
backend, and a **Vue 3** management UI.

## Current capabilities

- **Account onboarding:** Telethon, TData, and StringSession import; Telethon and TData
  export; phone-code, QR-code, and 2FA login.
- **Account-bound proxies:** HTTP, SOCKS5, MTProxy,
  [Resin](https://github.com/Resinat/Resin) sticky routes, and managed Cloudflare WARP,
  with per-account and batch binding, categories, used/unused filters, and egress IP,
  location, city, and ISP checks.
- **Safe first connection:** import and login select and freeze the route before the first
  Telegram request instead of connecting directly and changing IP afterward.
- **Account maintenance:** status checks, transient-connection recovery, safe invalid-account
  cleanup, device logout, 2FA, and recovery-email management.
- **Channels, groups, and bots:** creation, sync, categories, invitations, admin changes,
  public conversion, leave/disband operations, and link export.
- **Automation:** immediate and scheduled tasks, pause/edit/rerun controls, data dictionaries,
  templates, and optional OpenAI-compatible verification assistance.
- **Modules and APIs:** installable `.tpm` or `.zip` extensions for tasks, APIs, and management
  pages, with legacy Razor page compatibility.

## Account routes are managed by the host

Existing-account Telegram operations use the route assigned to that account. Modules should
call host account services with an `accountId`; they should not duplicate proxy credentials or
construct a separate `WTelegram.Client`. The host client pool applies the account's current
HTTP, SOCKS5, MTProxy, WARP, Resin, global-proxy, or explicit-direct route.

Selecting an existing proxy during import or login persists that proxy ID on the account until
an operator changes it. Selecting the global route instead keeps the account subscribed to later
global-route changes; explicit direct mode bypasses both account and global proxies. The global
route can reference any enabled manual, Resin, or WARP entry without copying its credentials.

Module-owned `HttpClient` and third-party API traffic do not automatically inherit an account
route. Configure those connections separately only when the module itself needs it.

See [Proxy management and account egress](docs/guides/proxy-management.md) and the
[module development guide](docs/developer/modules.md).

## Install with Docker

Requirements: Docker Engine, or Docker Desktop with WSL2 on Windows.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moeacgx/Telegram-Panel
cd Telegram-Panel
cp .env.example .env
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Open <http://localhost:5000> and sign in with the initial credentials:

- Username: `tgpanel`
- Password: `tgpanel123`

Change the initial password after the first sign-in. Persistent data is stored in
`./docker-data`; back up that directory before updates or migrations.

### Enable managed WARP

Managed WARP requires Linux containers and explicit Docker Socket access:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.warp.yml up -d
```

Set the automatic-creation default to `http` or `socks5` in `.env`:

```dotenv
TP_WARP_PROXY_PROTOCOL=http
```

Each managed WARP creates one Docker container and one persistent volume. Account imports use the
existing-WARP pool and distribute accounts toward routes with fewer bindings; they never create a
new container per account. Phone and QR login, plus account management, can still create a dedicated
WARP when explicitly requested, so size host memory and CPU for those operations.

Managed WARP health checks run every five minutes by default. Two consecutive failures trigger
a container restart, egress recheck, and reconnection of bound account clients without any
direct-connection fallback. Periodic restart of a healthy route is disabled by default to avoid
unnecessary Telegram IP changes; set `TP_WARP_SCHEDULED_REFRESH_ENABLED=true` to enable the
optional 720-minute refresh cycle. While an account import, phone login, or QR login is using a
WARP route, health recovery and manual mutation wait rather than changing the first-connection
egress.

Docker Socket access is close to host `root`; enable this overlay only on a trusted host.

## Download and update
